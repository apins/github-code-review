2. Wipe out outdated config data of merged or closed pull requests  (GitHub user api token with `repo` permission required);

3. Expose files count that passed review at pull requests list (GitHub user api token with `repo` permission required).

4. Floating file heading panel (very useful for large files).

5. Make configuration be synced globally and automatically (using Chrome's native sync).

6. Button to reset pull request config.
