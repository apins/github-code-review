Google Chrome extension to simplify core review of pull requests at GitHub
-

**Functionality:**

Each file gets own `Approve changes` button. Click on it collapses the file marking it as `passed review`.

**Nearest plans**

1. Make configuration be synced globally and automatically (using some global storage)

2. Expose approved/not approved files count at pull requests list.

3. Floating file heading panel (very useful for large files).

4. Button to reset pull request config.
