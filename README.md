Google Chrome extension to simplify code review of pull requests at GitHub
-

**Functionality:**

1. Each file gets own `Approve changes` button. Click on it collapses the file marking it as `passed review`.

2. Wipe out outdated config data of merged or closed pull requests  (GitHub user api token with `pull` permission required);

3. Expose approved/not approved files count at pull requests list (GitHub user api token with `pull` permission required).

**Nearest plans**

1. Make configuration be synced globally and automatically (using some global storages)

2. Floating file heading panel (very useful for large files).

3. Button to reset pull request config.
